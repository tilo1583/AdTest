Can you help him?"\r\n" Sir, I''m \r\nnot a vet, I''m a wildlife biologist," the young \r\nbiologist told the \r\nworried man.\r\n"Can you please just have a look at him, I''ll pay you \r\nanything you \r\nneed. I just need to know. If he''s still alive, maybe \r\nI can rush him \r\ninto town."\r\n"Ok, put him here on the table."

It can''t be true...are you sure?"\r\n"Yes, I''m quite \r\nsure."\r\n"I just can''t believe that....With all this equipment, isn''t \r\nthere \r\nsomething you can do? I must be absolutely sure."\r\nThe \r\nbiologist called his big yellow cat over to the table. The cat \r\nwalked \r\naround the dead dog, occasionally sniffing at the carcass. He then \r\nlooks \r\nup at the biologist and let out a few weak meows.\r\n"Well, the cat say \r\nhe''s dead. Does that assure you?"\r\n"No, I need more than that...Do \r\nyou have anything else?"\r\nThe biologist calls over his big black dog. \r\nThe dog circles the body a \r\nfew times, sniffing it every now and \r\nthen. After a few moments, the dog \r\nbarks at the biologist.\r\n"Well, \r\nnow the dog says he''s dead. That''s all I can do for you \r\n\r\nsir."\r\n"OK, well I guess its true. I''ll take him back and bury him...How \r\n\r\nmuch do I owe you?"\r\n"It''ll be $650 bucks." The biologist tells\r\n  the old man.\r\n"What??", replied the old man, "How can you charge \r\nthat much??!!"\r\n"Well sir, I could have told you he was dead for only a \r\ndollar, but \r\nyou''re the one that insisted on the cat scan and the \r\nlab tests!"');

Since \r\nthey are without \r\ntheir boyfriends and husbands, they decide to go \r\nin. \r\n\r\nThe bouncer, a very attractive guy, explains to them how it \r\nworks. "We \r\nhave 5 floors. Go up floor by floor, and once you find \r\nwhat you are \r\nlooking for, you can stay there. It''s easy to decide \r\nsince each floor has \r\na sign telling you what''s inside." \r\n\r\n\r\nThey start going up and on the first floor the sign reads, "All the \r\n\r\nmen on this floor are short and plain." The friends laugh and without \r\n\r\nhesitation move on to the next floor. \r\n\r\nThe sign on the second \r\nfloor reads, "All the men here are short and \r\nhandsome." Still, this \r\nisn''t good enough, so the friends continue on \r\nup. \r\n\r\nThey \r\nreach the third floor and the sign reads, "All the men here are \r\ntall \r\nand plain." They still want to do better, and so, knowing there \r\r\n nare still two floors left, they continue on up. \r\n\r\nOn the fourth \r\nfloor, the sign is perfect. "All the men here are tall \r\nand \r\nhandsome." The women get all excited and are about to go in when \r\nthey \r\nrealize that there is still one floor left. \r\n\r\nWondering what they \r\nwould be missing, they head on up to the fifth \r\nfloor. \r\n\r\nOn the \r\nfifth floor they find a sign that reads, "There are no men \r\nhere. This \r\nfloor was built only to prove that there is no way to please a \r\n\r\nwoman."');

"Throw \r\nthem to the lions" said \r\nthe head keeper, "the lions will eat anything". \r\nSo the young keeper \r\nreturned to the aquarium, picked up all the dead \r\nfish and threw \r\nthem into the lion''s cage.

"Dont \r\nworry" said the head \r\nkeeper, "just throw them to the lions, the lions \r\nwill eat anything".

It has also given rise \r\n\r\nto many unusual events. \r\nLast September one of the star \r\nattractions, Arnold, an Indonesian ape, \r\nescaped to the dismay of the zoo \r\ndirector. The matter was a serious one \r\nbecause the members of the \r\nstaff of the zoo, while expert at caring for \r\nanimals, had no \r\nexperience whatsoever in rounding them up or capturing \r\nthem. \r\n\r\nThe zoo \r\ndirector appealed to the office of the mayor for help and the \r\n\r\nsecretary to the mayor asked, "Have you looked in the yellow pages"? \r\nThe \r\ndirector said he hadn''t, but would, immediately. \r\n\r\nTo his \r\nsurprise, under "animal capturing service" he found a listing \r\nfor the \r\nAcme Ape Apprehenders. He called them immediately. \r\n\r\nWithin 20 \r\nminutes, a panel truck arrived at the admin office of the zoo \r\nand\r\n  a small man emerged and rushed to the director who was waiting at \r\n\r\nthe door. \r\n\r\n"Is there a wooded area in the vicinity?", the \r\nlittle man asked. The \r\ndirector said there was, within one half mile from \r\nthe zoo. "Hop in \r\nthe truck", the little man said.

An excited little dog jumped out \r\nand began running \r\naround in circles. \r\n\r\nThe little man reached \r\ninto the truck and took out a suitcase, which he \r\nopened. In the \r\nsuitcase were a pair of handcuffs, which he handed to \r\nthe zoo director, \r\na sawed off shotgun, which he leaned against the trunk \r\nof the tree, \r\nand a baseball bat. \r\n\r\n"Now," the little man said, "I''m going up \r\ninto the tree with the \r\nbaseball bat, and I''m going to knoc\r\n k the ape out of the tree. The \r\ninstant the ape hits the ground the \r\ndog, well trained, will bite the ape by \r\nthe crotch and chomp-down \r\nwith his jaws. The ape will, instantly and \r\ninstinctively, grab at \r\nhis crotch with both hands due to the pain, and you \r\nsnap the \r\nhandcuffs on and we''ve got him. \r\n\r\nThe zoo director, pointing to the \r\nshotgun leaning against the tree, \r\nsaid "I''m not too sure about this -- \r\nwhat''s the gun for?" \r\n\r\nThe little man said, "Look, I''m an \r\nexpert.
